                <p>My tech journey started with a degree in journalism. I loved researching, writing, and sharing my
                    voice online, but something felt missing. I wished for a way to share and display information
                    exactly the way I wanted. That's when I discovered and fell in love with coding and web design!
                </p>
                 <p>As a front end developer, I pride myself on writing code that's easy to read and build upon while
                    still looking great. My goal with every site is to provide a top-of-the-line user experience.
                    Besides web development, I enjoy gardening and spending time with my small (but growing!) family.
